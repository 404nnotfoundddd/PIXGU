# PIXGU Troubleshooting Guide

## Network Issues

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection

- Try refreshing the page or reconnecting

- Make sure you are not using vpn service

## Browser Settings

- Enable "Always Active" for PIXGU in your browser settings to prevent memory saving features from affecting performance.

## Always use the latest version of your browser

- Disable browser extensions that might interfere with PIXGU

- Clear browser cache and cookies

## Check our system status

Visit our home page and check the footer section to see if our servers are functioning normally or undergoing maintenance.

## Security Software

- Check if your firewall allows WebRTC connections

- Add "https://pixgu.com" to your antivirus whitelist

- Ensure security software isn't blocking "https://pixgu.com" or "https://ws.pixgu.com"
