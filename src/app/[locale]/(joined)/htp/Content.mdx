# How To Play

Welcome to PIXGU, a delightful drawing and guessing game that brings people together in a fun and engaging way. Whether you're an artistic mastermind or a wordsmith extraordinaire, PIXGU offers a unique opportunity to showcase your talents, test your skills, and connect with others who share your love for creative expression.

## Joining a Room

Getting started is simple - you can search for an existing room by name or ID, or create your own room as a host and invite other players to join. We're continuously working on adding more customization options for rooms to enhance your experience.

## Creating a Room

To create a new room, click on the "Create Room" button on the home page. You'll need to set a room name and choose your preferred game settings. You can also set a password if you want to keep the room private. Once created, you'll receive a unique room ID that you can share with friends to invite them directly.

## Drawing

When it's your turn in the game, you'll be given a secret word to draw. Using your mouse or touchscreen, you'll create your artistic interpretation for other players to guess.

## Guessing

While other players are drawing, you can submit your guesses through the chat. Quick and accurate guesses will reward you with more coins, so stay alert and think fast!

## Coins

The game features a reward system based on coins, which you can earn through successful guesses and speedy drawings. These coins help improve your position on the leaderboard and can be used to purchase power-ups and unlock exciting new features in the game.
